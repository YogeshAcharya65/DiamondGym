          <h2>HOW TO SUPPORT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</h2>
          <p>Wednesday, March 18, 2020</p>

        <div class="row w-100 ">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          <p class="para">It seems that there’s one word which is quite literally on everyone’s lips at the moment. The coronavirus or Covid-19 has instilled new meaning to the term “going viral” and the World Health Organisation has finally classified the global spread of this new kid on the block as a pandemic.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="para">
        Remove the middle three letters from this word and ironically, you’re left with “panic” which is perhaps the most immediate and obvious side-effect of the outbreak so far. Uncertainty is the oxygen that fuels this. Which is why we want to make sure that we provide our members with accurate up to date advice and guidance. And what we’re hearing is that you want to know how best to protect yourselves and your loved ones.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="para">
        We spoke with Dr. Sarah Hattam, who has supported us over the years in creating evidence backed content about wellbeing and health. Dr. Sarah has 25 years’ experience and is on a mission to fight the pseudo-science in the industry. She is passionate about sharing information that is backed by the latest science and research about how our human bodies and brains really thrive. This is what she had to say:

        First and foremost, it’s critical that we all follow the government’s advice which you can find here if you're living in the UK. Please make sure to follow the guidelines to help reduce the spread of the virus and help to flatten the curve.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="text">The most crucial advice is to wash hands frequently with soap and hot water for 30 seconds or 60% alcohol hand sanitiser if this isn’t available.</h4>

        <br>

        <p class="para">To always wash hands thoroughly before eating.  But we were doing this before anyway right? To avoid touching the face, mouth and eyes and to treat your mobile phone like a third hand, wiping it over with alcohol wipes regularly.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="para">As with any infection, our bodies have an army of immune cells ready to be deployed to wage war against such bugs. Our immune response is an incredible, but also complex system – that can become suppressed (weakened) as a result of some of our day to day habits. It is important to note is that there is no magic pill or solution to ‘boost’ your immune system, and because of the way our immune system is designed to work you really don’t want it to be ‘boosted’. But there are some simple steps you can take to help support your immune response - giving your immune system the best chance to fight coronavirus quickly and effectively.</p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="text">Studies show that people who don't get quality sleep or enough sleep are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus.</h4>

        <br>

        <p class="para">Not enough sleep can also affect how quickly you recover if you do get sick, as our white blood cells (also known as the body’s natural killer cells) become less effective when we are sleep deprived. But we understand that it’s not quite as easy as just saying ‘get more sleep’. Some simple tips to improve sleep quality are to ditch the devices before bed, avoid caffeine after mid-afternoon and remember to give yourself time to unwind from the day. A clear mind not only can help you drift off into dream land quicker, but also helps you reach the deep phase of sleep which is where the most restorative sleep happens.</p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="text">Research shows that adults who are physically active are almost half as likely to succumb to minor infections in comparison to sedentary adults</h4>

        <br>

        <p class="para">One reason for this is thought to be because exercise promotes good circulation. Good Circulation allows immune cells to move through your bloodstream and do their job more efficiently, meaning more effective scanning and action to deal with disease-causing bugs.</p>

        <br>

        <h5 class="text m-4">DON'T FORGET VITAMIN D</h5>

        <p class="para">Generally, a lot of emphasis is put on Vitamin A, C and E and their role in immune function. But it’s important to not forget Vitamin D. Not only does it play an essential role in supporting healthy bones but has also been recognised as supporting our immune system. Specifically, the immune response to viral infections. However, unsurprisingly 29% of adults have insufficient levels of vitamin D in the winter months [3]. This so-called sunshine vitamin is only manufactured in our body when sunlight hits our skin, making it common for us to be under the recommended 10ug per day.</p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="text">Therefore, it’s recommended that you include vitamin D rich food sources within your diet.</h4>

        <br>

        <p class="para">Foods such as oily fish, eggs and fortified cereals can help to increase vitamin D levels. But vitamin D supplements are also a good, cost-effective option which have even been shown to reduce respiratory infections and improve asthma control.</p>

        <br>

        <h5 class="text m-4">DIAL DOWN STRESS</h5>

        <p class="para">Easy for us to say, right?  21st century life is full on; we’re juggling competing demands and the incessant news chatter about the current pandemic isn’t exactly helping the situation. But we know that persistent stress and the subsequent release of stress hormones in our blood stream can damp down our immune system’s ability to respond effectively to infections.</p>
